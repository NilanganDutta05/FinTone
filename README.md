The project follows a **layered architecture**:

```
Frontend → API Routes → Services → Financial Calculations
```

This separation helps keep the project maintainable and easy to extend.

# 🧠 How It Works

1. The user enters investment details in the frontend.
2. The frontend sends the data to the backend API.
3. The backend processes the data using the financial calculation engine.
4. Cash flows and financial metrics are calculated.
5. Results are returned to the frontend and displayed to the user.
